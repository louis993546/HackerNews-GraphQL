# HackerNews GraphQL (or `hngql` for short)

While there is a [REST API from HackerNews](https://github.com/HackerNews/API), 
IMO that is not really easy to use at all. And with the help of 
[`99designs/gqlgen`](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen), It should make the
data easier to consume from client side üëç

## Current state

- Very much a WIP
- Only a very subset + happy path works

## Build & Run

- `go run server/server.go`
